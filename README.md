# FEATURE-ENGINEERING

The life cycle of implementing any data science projects begins with gathering data and cleaning the dataset (also known as data wrangling or feature engineering).

It is a crucial step as we prepare consistent data that can be fed to implement machine learning/deep learning project. It involves 
  - Handling NaN values
  - Handling imbalanced dataset
  - Removing noise / consistency in the file format
  - Normalizing data
  
In this repository, I have downloaded a 'Titanic.csv' data set/file to demonstrate feature engineering techniques. It is a step-by-step procedure I learned over a week and implemented it to gain hands-on knowledge.

I have utilized Python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib) to perform data Analysis and visualizations. 

  1) Pandas library was developed by Wes McKinney. It is used for Pandas is mainly used for data analysis. Pandas allows importing data from various file formats such as comma-separated values, JSON, SQL, Microsoft Excel. Pandas allows various data manipulation operations such as merging, reshaping, selecting, as well as data cleaning, and data wrangling features.
  
  2) NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
  
  3) Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
  
  4) Matplotlib.pyplot is a collection of functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc.

Implementing this repository helped me structure and organize my learning so far. It also offers me a strong foundations to go ahead and perform Explorative Data Analysis (EDA) on more data sets with deeper understanding. 

It is my pleasure to share this repository. If you have any feedback/questions please reach out to me.
