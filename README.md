# FEATURE-ENGINEERING

The life cycle of implementing any data science projects begins with gathering data and cleaning the dataset (also known as data wrangling or feature engineering).

It is crucial to prepare consistent data that is fed to implement machine learning/depth learning projects. It involves 
  - Handling NaN values
  - Handling imbalanced dataset
  - Removing noise/consistency in the file format
  - Normalizing data
  
I have downloaded a 'Titanic.csv' data set/file to demonstrate feature engineering techniques in this repository. It is a step-by-step procedure I learned over a week and implemented it to gain hands-on knowledge.

I have utilized Python libraries (Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib) to perform data analysis and visualizations. 

  1) Pandas library was developed by Wes McKinney. It is used for Pandas is mainly used for data analysis. Pandas allow importing data from various file formats such as comma-separated-values, JSON, SQL, Microsoft Excel. Pandas allow multiple data manipulation operations such as merging, reshaping, selecting, data cleaning, and data wrangling features.
  
  2) NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with an extensive collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
  
  3) Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
  
  4) Matplotlib.pyplot is a collection of functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB. Each pyplot function makes some change to a figure: e.g., creates a figure, creates a plotting area in a figure, plots some lines in a plotting area, decorates the plot with labels, etc.

Implementing this repository helped me structure and organize my learning so far. It also offers me a strong foundation to perform Explorative Data Analysis (EDA) on more data sets with more in-depth understanding. 

It is my pleasure to share this repository. If you have any feedback/questions, please reach out to me.
